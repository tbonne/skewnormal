# Abstract 

Animal displays often involve extreme behaviors that seem to push signalers to the limits of their abilities. If motor constraints limit display performance, signal evolution will be constrained, and displays can function as reliable “index” signals of quality. Measuring constraints from behaviour can be difficult because existing approaches require multiple kinds of behavioural data. A method that requires only one kind of data could up open new research directions. We propose a new conceptual model of performance under constraint, which predicts that the distribution of constrained performance will skew away from the constraint. We tested this prediction with sports data, because we know a priori that athletic performance is constrained and that athletes attempt to maximize performance. Among elite athletes in a variety of sports, performance was consistently skewed in the predicted direction. We then used statistical models based on the skew normal distribution to estimate the constraints on athletes and displaying animals. We conclude that motor constraints tend to generate skewed behavior and that skew normal models can be used to estimate constraints from a single axis of behavioral data. These findings expand the toolkit for identifying, characterizing, and comparing performance constraints for applications in animal behavior, physiology, and sports.

Constraint curves extracted from skew normal distribution models: a) plot of the constraint curve for a 20-year-old male/female, and 60-year-old male/female, b) constraint curves for five birds, and c) constraint curve for bird 2 at different times of the day. The five birds selected for b) were chosen because they had the largest samples (> 6000 notes / bird).*
